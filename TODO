- When arg-substituting, each arg must maintain the same white-space distance
  from the previous token as maintained by the corresponding macro in the
  replacement-list. If the arg corresponds to the first element in the
  replacement-list, its first token must maintain the same white-space distance
  as maintained by the invocation from the token previous to the invocation.
- Suppose '#define str(s) #s'. Then str(\n) should not duplicate the
  back-slash.
- Support __has_include, __has_embed __has_c_attribute.
- Translate char-consts and string-literals to exec-char-format.
